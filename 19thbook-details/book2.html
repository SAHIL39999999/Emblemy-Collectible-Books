                <p>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a timeless novel of love, class, and self-discovery, set in early 19th-century England. The story follows the witty and independent Elizabeth Bennet, the second of five daughters in a respectable but financially modest family. When the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy enters her social circle, Elizabeth is quick to judge him as arrogant and prideful, while he secretly struggles with his growing admiration for her.

                    As their paths continue to cross, misunderstandings, societal expectations, and personal flaws threaten to keep them apart. Through sharp dialogue and keen social observation, Austen explores themes of pride, prejudice, and the importance of self-awareness in matters of the heart. Alongside Elizabeth and Darcyâ€™s evolving relationship, the novel paints a rich picture of Regency-era society, complete with meddling relatives, comical suitors, and strict class divisions.
                    
                    With its unforgettable characters, witty humor, and insightful commentary on love and society, Pride and Prejudice remains one of the most beloved and influential novels in English literature.</p>
