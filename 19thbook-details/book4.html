                <p>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a psychological and philosophical novel that explores guilt, redemption, and the complexities of human nature. Set in 19th-century St. Petersburg, the story follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a destitute but intelligent former student who commits a brutal murder, believing he is justified in his actions by a theory that certain individuals have the right to transgress moral laws for a greater purpose.

                    However, after the crime, Raskolnikov is consumed by guilt and paranoia, leading him into a psychological battle between justification and conscience. As he struggles with his torment, he encounters a cast of compelling characters, including the kind and self-sacrificing Sonia Marmeladov, the cunning and relentless investigator Porfiry Petrovich, and the manipulative Arkady Svidrigailov.
                    
                    Dostoyevsky masterfully weaves a gripping narrative that delves into existentialism, morality, and the consequences of alienation. With its intense psychological depth and philosophical reflections, Crime and Punishment remains one of the most profound and influential novels in world literature.</p>
