                <h2 class="text-center ">Description </h2>
                <p>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a classic American novel that explores themes of freedom, morality, and societal hypocrisy through the eyes of its young protagonist, Huckleberry "Huck" Finn. Set along the Mississippi River in the pre-Civil War South, the novel follows Huck as he escapes his abusive father and embarks on a journey of adventure and self-discovery with Jim, a runaway enslaved man seeking freedom.

                    As they navigate the river, Huck and Jim encounter a cast of colorful characters—con men, feuding families, and misguided do-gooders—that expose the contradictions and injustices of society. Through Huck’s evolving moral conscience and his deepening friendship with Jim, Twain delivers a sharp critique of racism, class divisions, and the flawed values of civilization.
                    
                    Filled with humor, suspense, and Twain’s signature satirical wit, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is more than just an adventure story—it is a profound and enduring exploration of American identity, human dignity, and the meaning of true freedom.</p>
