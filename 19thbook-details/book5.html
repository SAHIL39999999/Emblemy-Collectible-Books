                <p>David Copperfield by Charles Dickens is a coming-of-age novel that follows the life and struggles of its titular character, from childhood to adulthood. Written as a fictional autobiography, the novel chronicles David Copperfield’s journey through hardship, love, loss, and self-discovery in 19th-century England.

                    Born into a difficult childhood, David faces cruelty at the hands of his stepfather, Mr. Murdstone, and is eventually sent to work in a harsh factory. Determined to build a better life, he escapes to his eccentric but kind-hearted Aunt Betsey Trotwood, who helps him pursue an education. Along the way, David encounters a rich cast of characters, including his loyal friend Peggotty, the charming but deceitful Uriah Heep, the good-natured but irresponsible Mr. Micawber, and his great love, Agnes Wickfield.
                    
                    As David navigates friendship, betrayal, success, and heartbreak, Dickens weaves a powerful narrative about resilience, ambition, and the search for identity. With its vivid characters, emotional depth, and sharp social commentary, David Copperfield remains one of Dickens’ most beloved and influential novels, often regarded as his most personal work.</p>
