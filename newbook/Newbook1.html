                <p>Bonded in Death is the sixtieth installment in J.D. Robb's futuristic police procedural series, set in 21st-century New York City. The story centers on Lieutenant Eve Dallas, who investigates the murder of Giovanni Rossi, a man with ties to a secret organization from the Urban Wars era known as The Twelve. As Eve delves deeper, she discovers that her household's major-domo, Summerset, was once a member of this clandestine group. The case becomes personal as the killer targets remaining members of The Twelve, compelling Summerset to confront his past to aid in the investigation. Robb masterfully intertwines themes of loyalty, treachery, and the lingering effects of war, delivering a compelling narrative that explores the shadows of history and the bonds that persist through time.</p>
