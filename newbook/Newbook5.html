                <p>You Deserve to Be Rich: Master the Inner Game of Wealth and Claim Your Future is a groundbreaking guide by Rashad Bilal and Troy Millings, founders of the popular financial literacy platform and podcast Earn Your Leisure. This New York Times bestseller offers a comprehensive playbook for building generational wealth, regardless of your background or upbringing. 
                    
                    Drawing from their personal experiences and the insights gained through their platform, Bilal and Millings address the psychological impact of living paycheck to paycheck, providing strategies to heal from financial trauma and reshape your relationship with money. They delve into income-building avenues beyond traditional employment, including long-term and short-term investments in often-overlooked sectors, as well as side hustles with the potential for passive income. 
                    
                    The authors also demystify complex topics such as taxation and insurance, highlighting legal strategies to maximize wealth. They navigate the intricate dynamics of family expectations that can complicate financial planning, offering sustainable methods to support both your loved ones and your community.</p>
