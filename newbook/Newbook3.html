                <p>Paranoia is the seventeenth installment in James Patterson's acclaimed Michael Bennett series. In this gripping psychological thriller, NYPD Detective Michael Bennett faces a chilling challenge as a serial killer targets his fellow officers. With an increasing number of his colleagues falling victim, Bennett is assigned by NYPD Inspector Celeste Cantor to investigate these deaths under a special assignment, reporting exclusively to her. As he delves deeper into the case, Bennett finds himself pursuing a murderer who thrives on isolation and feeds on paranoia, pushing him to his limits both professionally and personally. Patterson masterfully weaves a tale of suspense and tension, exploring themes of loyalty, fear, and the psychological toll of being hunted. Paranoia is a compelling addition to the Michael Bennett series, showcasing the protagonist's relentless determination to protect his family, his city, and his fellow officers.</p>
